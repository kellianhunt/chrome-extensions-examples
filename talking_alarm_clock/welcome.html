            <h1>Welcome to The Talking Alarm!</h1>
            <p>The Talking Clock Extension allows you to create alarms with
                customizable sounds and turn off alarms with the voice command "OFF".
            </p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>To enable voice commands, the alarm extension will need access to your microphone.
                If a popup requesting permission did not appear upon opening this page, check
                for a little camera symbol on the far right of your search bar. Click this symbol
                and allow the extension to use your microphone.
            </p>
            <p>To test voice commands, create an alarm, and when it rings, say "Off" to your device.</p>
